30-Day DSA Consistency Challenge 💪 — Gowri Sankar Kasarapu (B.Tech, AI & ML — 2025)

I’m kicking off a 30-day Data Structures & Algorithms journey to build problem-solving muscle, prepare for placements and internships, and level up my backend & ML engineering skills. I’ll solve at least one LeetCode problem a day, log my progress, and iterate on weak areas.

**Goal**

Build daily coding consistency and improve algorithmic thinking.

Cover core DSA topics for interviews (arrays, strings, hashing, stacks/queues, trees, graphs, DP).

Translate problem knowledge into better code for MERN + ML projects and interviews.

Day 1 — Progress ✅

Problems solved

Add Two Integers — LeetCode 2235

Concatenation of Array — LeetCode 1929

Move Zeroes — LeetCode 283
Status: Done ✔️


**Why this matters (short)**

As a final-year B.Tech (AI & ML) student graduating in 2025 with experience in MERN and Python, strengthening DSA will:

Make my code more efficient and reliable for production web apps and ML pipelines.

Improve my performance in coding interviews and hackathons.

Help me architect better backend services and data processing routines.


30-Day focus roadmap

Days 1–5: Arrays & Two-pointer / Sorting basics

Days 6–10: Strings & Hashing

Days 11–15: Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists

Days 16–21: Trees (BST) & Recursion

Days 22–25: Graphs (BFS/DFS basics)

Days 26–30: Dynamic Programming fundamentals

Days 30+: Mixed problems + mock interview practice



**Quick tips**

Aim for consistency over volume: a single well-solved problem beats rushed attempts.

Read others’ solutions after you solve a problem to learn alternate patterns.

Write clear, commented code and practice explaining your approach out loud.

Track weak topics and re-visit them after day 15.
